An ultra-nifty diagraming package. Reads text files containing markup code.

These are just some personal notes. I'm thinking of using this most excellent package to do the diagrams here,
for PerlDesignPatterns. 

Minimal example:

  graph: { 
  title: "Civilisation Advances"
  x: 30
  y: 30
  height: 700
  width: 700
  # nodes and edges
  }

Some more root-level options:

  layoutalgorithm: minbackward
  layoutalgorithm: minbackward
  layoutalgorithm: mindepth
  layoutalgorithm: maxdepth
  layoutalgorithm: tree
  layoutalgorithm: dfs # some edges go up. we give them lower priority, and the diagram is structured according to the down edges.
  crossing_weight: median
  crossing_weight: bary
  crossing_weight: barymedian
  crossing_weight: medianbary
  display_edge_labels: yes
  nearedges: no
  shrink: 2
  stretch: 1
  color: lightgreen
  node.color: pink
  edge.color: red
  edge.backarrowcolor: pink
  edge.backarrowstyle: solid
  edge.backarrowsize: 10
  port_sharing: yes
  port_sharing: no
  arrowmode: fixed 
  arrowmode: free
  layout_nearfactor: 0
  layout_upfactor: 40 
  xbase: 75 
  xspace: 10 
  xlspace: 10 
  xraster: 75
  yspace: 30
  priority_phase: yes
  straight_phase: yes
  foldnode.shape: triangle


Minimal node syntax:

  node: { title: "01" label: "Irrigation" }

Minimal edge syntax:

  edge: { color: lightblue sourcename: "05" targetname:"11" }

Example edge and node:

  node: {  title: "Reactive Engine" shape: rhomb width: 144 height: 90 color: yellow bordercolor: blue }
  node: {  title: "Alto" shape: ellipse color: darkgreen textcolor: lightyellow }

  edge: { sourcename: "Reactive Engine" targetname: "Alto" }


Maximal node syntax:

  node: {
    title: "A2"
    loc: { x: 300 y: 10 } 
    shrink: 3
    stretch: 2
    label: 
  "Foo bar
  Baz qux"
    textmode: left_justify
    borderwidth: 10
    color: lightblue
    textcolor: lightyellow
    bordercolor: red
    shape: box
    anchor: 1
    level: 1 horizontal_order: 1
  }

  # or...

  textmode: right_justify 
  textmode: center # center is default
  shape: rhomb
  shape: triangle
  shape: ellipse
  shape: circle
  level: 0 # 1, 2, 3, etc. litteraly, which row to force it into.
  

Maximal edge syntax:

  edge: { sourcename: "E1" targetname: "E2" 
          linestyle: continuous 
          thickness:a 4
          label: "continuous"
          arrowsize: 13
          arrowstyle: line
          priority: 4       # has to do with sorting things onto the screen according to the algorithm
  }

  # or...

  linestyle: dotted
  linestyle: dashed

  # or...

   nearedge:  { sourcename: "502952" targetname: "T2" 
     color: blue thickness: 6  }

Near Edges:

Nearedges are horizontal edges that constain the two adjacent
nodes to be placed directly neighbored at the same level.
Bent nearedges are edges that are bent at the label, and
the source node and the edge label form a near edge. This gives
the typical appearance of decision branches.

  foldnode.shape: triangle
  splines: yes
  layout_nearfactor: 0
  layout_upfactor: 40
  manhatten_edges: yes
